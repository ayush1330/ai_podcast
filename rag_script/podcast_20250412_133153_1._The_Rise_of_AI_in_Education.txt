Hello and welcome! I'm your host Jane, and today we're diving into the fascinating world of AI in education. Imagine a high school student named Emma. She used to struggle with chemistry, feeling lost and overwhelmed. Then her school introduced Knewton, an AI-powered platform. At first, Emma was skeptical—who wouldn't be? But as she started using it, something magical happened. The system analyzed her performance and tailored exercises just for her. Before she knew it, her grades soared, and her confidence blossomed. 

Now, let’s shift gears to Mr. Smith, a college professor. Picture him drowning in a sea of assignments, spending hours grading. He decided to try Gradescope, and wow, what a game-changer! The AI tool streamlined his grading process, giving him more time to connect with students—imagine the difference that made! 

So, whether you’re a student or a teacher, AI is reshaping education in ways we never thought possible. Curious about how these tools could change your learning journey? Keep exploring, and who knows what you'll discover next!
