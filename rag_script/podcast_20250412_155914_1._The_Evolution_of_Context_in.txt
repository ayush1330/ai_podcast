Hello and welcome! I'm your host Jane, and today, we're diving into the quirky world of AI and context. Ever had a chat with an AI that left you scratching your head? Picture this: you tell a chatbot, “I loved watching that superhero film last week,” and it replies, “Great! Here’s a recipe for pumpkin spice latte.” Hilarious, right? But it also shows a big gap in understanding context.

You see, context is like the backstage crew of a conversation. It helps AI pick up on the subtleties—like what you really mean and what you want to hear. Early AI models completely flopped at this. They were like a robot trying to dance without music—just awkward and lost!

But here’s where things get exciting! With innovations like the Model Context Protocol, AI is learning to connect the dots better. Imagine chatbots that remember your preferences, making your conversations feel more personal and less robotic. 

As we explore this together, I invite you to think about your own experiences with AI. What funny mishaps have you encountered? Let’s unravel this mystery of context in AI, one laugh at a time!
