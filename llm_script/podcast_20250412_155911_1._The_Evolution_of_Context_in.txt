Hello and welcome! I'm your host, Jane, and today we're diving into the amusing world of AI and context. Now, picture this: you’re at a café, and you casually mention to your voice assistant, “Play some music.” 

But instead of your favorite tunes, it starts blasting a motivational podcast about “How to Train Your Pet Goldfish.” Wait, what? You can imagine the confused stares from fellow coffee drinkers, right? 

This, my friends, is a classic case of AI missing the context. It heard "play" and "music," but without understanding your mood or your love for indie rock, it went completely off track. 

You see, context in AI is crucial. It’s like having a friend who knows when you need a pick-me-up versus when you want to chill. The Model Context Protocol, or MCP, helps AI get smarter about these nuances. 

So, next time your AI assistant misunderstands you, just remember—it's a work in progress! Keep exploring the fascinating evolution of context in AI. Who knows? The next time you ask for music, it might just surprise you!
